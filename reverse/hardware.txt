Overall PCB Model: PCB170413A

Silicon Labs has a tutorial to communicate with UART over HID devices, which I suspect is similar to what is happening here.

Previous models of the MSRX0X(X) family (e.g. MSR605) are compatible with the PL-2303 USB-to-UART driver. Following this, it
makes sense that the creators of this product have reused most of their device commands (and software).

===================
NAME: ANT2801 (5V USB Input Two-Cell Lithium Battery Efficient Charge Management IC)

The marking on this chip are:
"""
ANT2801
HA1736
"""

Notes:
This chip is located near the battery on the PCB (U2).

Here's a wireout diagram of it:

===================
NAME: Silicon Labs Universal Bee 2 32-bit Microcontroller

The marking on this chip are:
"""
EFM8
UB20F32G
B00PQB
1742 B
"""

Notes:
Universal Bee 2 Family
Family Feature Set 0
It looks like a QFP package is used here.
===================
NAME: MX612E Motor Driver Integrated Circuit

The marking on this chip are:
"""
MX612E
1727H
"""

Notes:
It's a motor driver. Wew.
===================
NAME: TL062C Low Power JFET Amplifier

The marking on this chip are:
""
062C
(ST) <<I could not read this part>>
""

Notes:
Connected to motor/generator (BPI).
